	                I grew up in Hawaii and now live in SF. And for almost a year I've been working on an app to create better social spaces. Before starting this, I was on a trip with my mother, riding along on a busy but quiet road in Rwanda. Motorcycles were speeding by narrowly passing with their passengers. Some people noticed we were foreigners (mzungu) and waved. They smiled and waved to us as if we were long-lost family.

                   It's still hard to believe the atrocities which occurred here, about 30 years ago. The estimated 500,000 to 1 million people brutally slaughtered. The 250,000 to 500,000 estimated rapes. We were headed to an orphanage for children born with AIDS and it was hard to share their happiness and gratitude. But they had community here, and faith, and you could feel that. It was genuine. </blockquote>

	                That was something I don't want to forget as I walk my neighborhood. As we step around needles and people living on the streets. We can isolate, watch movies, and have anything we need delivered so we never have to interact. But there are consequences. I've learned more developed countries have less developed communities. I'm hopeful we can change that. Shared success is happiness multiplied.
